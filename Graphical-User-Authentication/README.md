# Graphical-User-Authentication by Matthew Austin
Designed and programmed a graphical password authentication system that works by having the user select from images, in a specific order, presented in a graphical user interface (GUI). This approach is not only better in regards to increasing the security of a system but also decreasing threats such as SQL injection and brute force, but more importantly human error.

Authentication technology is the main defense in information security, Graphical User Authentication (GUA) is superior in usability and security when compared to traditional forms of authentication such as text/alphanumeric based passwords. Alphanumeric passwords compared to graphical passwords are more susceptible to attacks but more importantly human error. 
To solve this problem, Graphical User Authentication fixes information securityâ€™s weakest link, human error. Graphical Authentication is more user friendly by utilizing images and memory based techniques such as recall and recognition as they increase a users ability to make more complex, harder to hack passwords and remember them with ease. The structure of the graphical password authentication system prevents common alphanumeric authentication attacks such as sql injection and keylogging. By eliminating the common flaws that make alphanumeric passwords an easy target in this day in age, the Graphical User Authentication system drastically decreases malicious attacks and human error.
